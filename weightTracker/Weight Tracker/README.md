## How It's Made:
**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, NodeJS, Express, MongoDB, EJS
Used EJS and MongoDB along with the Express module to create this Weight Tracker app. Added minimal CSS for style and a backgroud image.

## Lessons Learned
Sometimes copying and pasting previous code can cause problems, just like what I have just dealt with. Found difficulty in creating and pushing my repo, possible error on my part, regardless I may have gotten too comfortable and made a mistake.
