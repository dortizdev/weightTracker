## How It's Made:
**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, NodeJS, Express, MongoDB, EJS
Utilized EJS to incorporate HTML with JS. Used a background image with section covering it to provide opacity to better see the list items. Connected to MongoDB external database to store data.

## Lessons Learned
Wanted to add some style to it by giving it a background. Found it difficult to read list items so I had to search and find a way to alter the opacity of background. Learned it wasn't as simple to do on CSS, but found an excellent example courtesy of the Stack Overflow community.
